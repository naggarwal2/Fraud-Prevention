I analyzed the Bank Account Fraud Dataset from the NeurIPS 2022 competition (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sgpjesus/bank-account-fraud-dataset-neurips-2022). This dataset consists of transactional and user-related attributes that can be used to detect fraudulent activities in financial systems.
I developed a supervised learning model to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent as bank frauds are growing rapidly
I started off with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns and trends, followed by feature selection methods to refine the  model inputs. For modeling, I compared various classification techniques, including "KNN", "Decision Tree", "Random Forest", "Gradient Boosting", "AdaBoost", "Logistic Regression" evaluating their performance using appropriate metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
